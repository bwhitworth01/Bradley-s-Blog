This week’s reading seemed to be centered around the debates surrounding certain base forms of communication and spreading of information. The readings concerning the telegraph and the “end-to-end” term were based on controversy and the author’s opinion that there was a lack of respect towards each of these. I was fascinated mainly by how the telegraph transformed businesses when it was created. 
It seemed natural to me to assume that the telegraph would separate physical movement from communication. However, I found the section about arbitrage and the transformation of business language incredibly interesting. The telegraph greatly expanded business markets for all consumers and in all cities because communication was so quick and streamlined. The specific example from the reading talked about how the market in Cincinnati completely changed with the telegraph because all prices on the market became available (Carey 2009). 
The “end-to-end” conversation was very informative in explaining the means by which technology works. The internet was a revolutionary innovation because it made the world monumentally smaller and more connected; the way it did this was debated between “end-to-end” technology and the virtual circuit. The “end-to-end” technology was based on the idea of sending information directly from point A to B in a straightforward manner. On the other hand the virtual circuit was based on systems that could relay information intermittently. The ultimate argument seemed to be that “end-to-end” technology is more effective based on its general flexibility whereas with the virtual circuit its complexity limited the ability to update with applications(Gillespie 2006). Despite this argument, the idea that information could be broken up and spread out arbitrarily then could recollect on a screen was an incredible discovery but was also one that required significant litigation (Gillespie 2006). 
In the court of law “end-to-end” technology has been defined a number of ways based on its purpose (Gillespie 2006). In many cases the purposes have differed but overall the main use of “end-to-end” technology has been in creating a functioning internet and actually understanding how it works. The wildly misunderstood reality of the internet is that it is made up of a number of layers to carry and spread information using programs related to html. The litigation in particular over “end-to-end” technology was relatable to another of our readings concerning the cyclical nature of major discoveries. Monumental discoveries pique public excitement, satisfy wants for a period, then a new issue arises and the cycle restarts (Wu 2010). Litigation comes into effect in the production of innovations and releasing them to the public. Overall, the debates set forth in this week’s readings introduced many major means of communication and spread of information.
